## What is a Language Server?
A language server is a standalone program that provides language-specific features like *code completion*, *syntax checking*, *go-to definition*, and more to an editor or IDE via the Language Server Protocol (LSP). It acts as a backend, processing requests from the editor and returning results to enhance coding productivity and accuracy.
